# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose and Description of what was accomplished

The purpose of this assignment is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we are working on will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have used unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will use clustering algorithm. We have also used data visualizations to share the findings.

We were able to visualize the Cryptocurrencies results with the help of 3D-Scatter with Clusters:
